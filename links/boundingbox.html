    <h2>Problem: </h2>
    <p>Bounding Box, given the points of a polygon. Can we figure out if another point is inside it? </p>
    <p> Yes, I know this is an easy problem to solve. <a

        But this problem has a few great pros:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is easy to create a lot of data for this problem.</li>
        <li>It is easy to solve with heuristic -- so it probably is also easily solvable with ML.</li>
        <li> Great for familiarizing with pytorch!</li>
    </ul>
