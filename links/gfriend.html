<h3>Context/Meaning</h3>
<p>I'll begin this analysis by explaining the meaning behind the lyrics and context of the song - Sunrise. This song is preceded by a song called 'Time for the Moon Night', which is more a 'mirror' of the current song than a prequel. The lyrics of 'Time for the Moon Night' portrays the separation of a pair of lovers during the night time, it portrays the sadness and the thoughts prior to the separation and ends with the departure at night as the character (I) hopes to meet the partner in his/her dreams. </p>
<p>This song sunrise, naturally, symbolizes the 'Sunrise' following the departure of that night. interestingly, as the previous song was almost melancholic and calming, this song is not that at all (even melodically they are very similar). This song is relatively more intense, but yet at the same cheerful and hopeful.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it depicts the main character's anxiousness and confusion the next morning (B1), while slowly moving to a more hopeful tone of awaiting the day when they reunite.(A1) This then leads to realization that sleeping/ignoring such feelings is not beneficial (B2). This realization brings forth the determination to await the day when the partner returns, giving a hopeful yet sad tone. (A2) The final part of the song is where the character (I) commits to the decision with intense determination. (C-A3-D)</p>

    <h3>Key/Tone</h3>
    <p> I will dive into the details in a later section, but overall this song is in the key of F# minor. It was quite difficult to pinpoint this key since there is a lack of 3 and 7s (A and E), but if we take into account the whole song, this is very much intentional. As the tone of this song is 'hopeful while melancholic', by avoiding the degrees that strongly suggests a minor, the song was able to prevent the 'sadness' of a minor key to overwhelm the song.</p>
    <p> The verses of this song represents segments of thoughts and pondering, which is more calming and joyful, while the choruses conclusions and decision from these thoughts. One really impressive feature of this song are the transitions, such as the prechorus and post chorus. The former pushes the relaxing tone of the verses into the a more hopeful and strong chorus, and the latter intensely concluding the decision in order to return to another thought (verse). </p>
    <p>The final C-A3-D does a fantastic job to push the intensity of the song to a maximum. A calming C-section with almost no instrumentals, leading into a chorus in the key of G-minor, with a powerful climax in that key in the E-section. The key change by up a half step was just enough to push the intensity of the piece while maintaining coherence between sections.</p>


<h2> Verses </h2>
<center>
    <img src = "../media/gfriend/verse.PNG" width="550px" height="300px"></img> 
    </center>
    <p> Let us look at the repeating part of the verse, I will first analyze the repeating melody of the verse (figure above). If we use the key of F# minor to analyze this part (black), we'll find that the piece starts on a tonic, but then proceeds to use a lot of predominant and mediant/submediant chords such as III and VI. One thing that stood out to me is the presence of the major I chord, which shouldn't appear in F# minor, and the ending with III. So if we look at this progression from the key of A major - the relative major of F# minor, we would find more interesting progressions. </p>
    <p>Here we find that after the first chord which is a tonic in f#minor, the verse almost follows a standard I-IV-V-I progression, or a T-SD-D-T progression. Other than following the progression, it also is like a period in the sense that both 4-bar parts starts with similar melodies, but both end with authentic cadences. Also the verse's abundant usage of E natural also reinforces the sound of being in A major.</p>
    <p>The verse is the most calming and uplifting section of the song, the calming feel comes from the fact that it follows a common and familiar progression of T-PD-D-T, this allows the listener to feel settled in the melody. The fact that although technically in the key of F# minor, the progression following A major also gives the verse its joyful atmosphere.</p>

    </p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<h3>Pre-chorus</h3>
<center>
    <img src = "../media/gfriend/prechorus.PNG" width="550px" height="200px"></img> 
    </center>
    <p>Keeping in mind that the prechorus follows the verse, which ends on a III (or I in A major). The former 2 bars of the pre chorus follows a PD-D-T type of progression if we look at the chords in a key of A major (red), but the ending chord F#-A-C#-E (measure 19) actually has both the tonic of F# minor and A major, which is perfect to do a 'transition' to back to F# minor from the major-like verse. The latter half of the pre chorus was analyzed in F# minor (black) and it ends on iv6-V, which is a phrygian cadence! This further enforces that the piece is about to go into F# minor  - which we would see in the next section the chorus is in. </p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<center>
    <img src = "../media/gfriend/chorus.PNG" width="550px" height="430px"></img> 
    </center>
    <p>One fascinating thing about the chorus is that the first 2 bars of the melody creates a very rigid image of sunrise. Other than the fact that say sunrise twice, the chord progression is i-iv-VII-III, which seems weird at first, but if we treat VII-III as V-I in a major, it would make a lotmore sense. The image of sunrise is created by an openess in sound along with the increase in pitch. The openess is created by transitioning from minor chords to major chords, while the two consecutive 3-scale-degree leaps also helps with the openess and creatins an uplifting sound that gives hope to the melody. The following two bars follow a typical T-SD-D pattern. The chord progression in these two bars are repeated, so the chorus ends on a V chord.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Post-chorus</h3>
<center>
    <img src = "../media/gfriend/postchorus.PNG" width="550px" height="300px"></img> 
    </center>
    <p>The postchorus is what transitions from a strong chorus back to a calming verse/section. If we analyze this in F# minor, this would tell us that this section follows and overall T-PD-D-T-D and ends one a half cadence that leads us seamlessly to the verse (which starts with i). The presence of I however, suggests to look at this part from A major, specifcally the SD part. We would see an almost D-T progression (red). The presence of II III and VII chords (in both keys) help make this transition between minor to major and major to minor smoothly. This allows the song to transition between  determined and melancholic to uplifitng and calm without the piece feeling awkward.</p>

<h2> Special parts </h2>
<h3>Key change</h3>
<center>
    <img src = "../media/gfriend/calm.png" width="550px" height="230px"></img> 
    </center>
<p>The key change up a half step to G minor here is definitely what pushes the atmosphere of the song into a even more intense and determined state. By ending the C section with an 'upward' sequence of chords (iv-Vdim7 V), this builds intensity and ending on a dominant leads us to the transition. The transition is another sequence of upward chords (V-V6-VI-VI6), which again builds up tension. One extra feature is that the VI chord is the dominant of G-minor, so this allows the key change to flow naturally. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Climax/Outro</h3>
    <center>
    <img src = "../media/gfriend/climax.png" width="550px" height="300px"></img> 
    </center>
    <p> The climax/ending of the song is signified by the contrary motion in the bass and soprano. Other than that, the i-V65-III64 motion has a common D in the alto, which is the dominant of G minor, following with a IV6, this almost resembles a deceptive cadence, giving the climax (IV6) a boost in strength. The rest of the outro wraps up the piece ending with a authentic cadence.</p>
