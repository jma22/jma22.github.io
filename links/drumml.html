    <h2> What I did</h2>
    <p> I joined when most of the UI and gesture controls were created. So I had to design a backend with Google Action,Firebase and DialogFlow that can 
        work with the React-based gesture controls.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created basic commands to navigate between pages, but also multimodal commands such as 'openthis', to open a file a user is currently pointing at.
        I also played around with the Prismatic API for creating AR content on a website.
