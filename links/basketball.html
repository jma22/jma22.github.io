        Autonomous basketball hoop </h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>tldr;</h2>
    <p>I made a basketball hoop that moves toward the ball</p>

    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p> This was a project I did with 5 other of my friends at as an internship with AC Kinetics in Bedford NY. The goal of the project 
        was to make a basketball hoop that moves in one dimension to attempt to 'catch' the basketball. Documentation
        was kind of lacking but I'll see what I got. (I mainly worked on designing, hardware, and a little on the coding side)

    <h2>Some actual CAD-ing</h2>
    <p> I had to CAD and 3dprint a clip to attatch the plexiglass to the timing belt </p>

    <h2>Some actual coding</h2>
    <a href = "https://github.com/jdeitelzweig/ACKinetics"><p>Not my git, but here's the code. May include python, arduino and openCV</p></a>
    <p> Basically we are tracking a green ball using a webcam and linearly predicting where the ball would be</p>

    <h2> Testing </h2>
    <center>
        <video autoplay = "autoplay" loop = "loop" muted = "muted" width="20%" height="20%">
            <source src="../media/hoopy/8.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </center>
    <p>We then added a low pass filter to the movement, and a hardware switch to prevent the platform from going pass the range and to calibrate position.</p>


    <h2> Final </h2>
    <center>
            <video autoplay = "autoplay" loop = "loop" muted = "muted" width="48%" height="48%">
            <source src="../media/hoopy/9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <video autoplay = "autoplay" loop = "loop" muted = "muted" width="48%" height="48%">
                <source src="../media/hoopy/10.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <video autoplay = "autoplay" loop = "loop" muted = "muted" width="48%" height="48%">
                    <source src="../media/hoopy/11.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
    </center>
    <p> Notice that we were bouncing the ball on the floor, since the hoop doesn't react fast enough for the ball to be thrown airbourne.
        Also note that if we don't bounce it high enough the hoop matches the x axis, but can't go in :(
