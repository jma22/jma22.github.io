        <p class="text">Conducted a study w/ Alex for 9.66[Computational Cognitive Science] that suggests a possible representation of frequency adverbs in our cognition</p>


    <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="text"> Uncertainty is built into the nature of our world, but what capacity does language have to transmit information about probabilities? Is there a mathematical framework which can model
            the human-interpreted uncertainties encoded in frequency adverbs? To answer these questions, we first developed a framework for understanding the way humans interpret frequency
            adverbs. Next, we applied a hierarchical Bayesian structure to
            model the effects of uncertainty modifiers in high-order probabilistic phrases (those with multiple frequency adverbs). Finally, we experimentally tested our model against psychophysical data. Our results demonstrate the validity of our mathematical notion of nested frequency adverb structures and the
            decomposability of high-order phrases. Furthermore, they
            shed light into the internal sampling system humans use in natural language processing</p>

    <p class="text"> A summary of steps in the study</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fit each word to the sample data (histogram) with a beta distribution (<i>Single Word Empirical Distribution</i>)</li><br>
            <li> Use variational apporximation to obtain negated distributions (<i>Negated Word Distribution</i>)</li><br>
            <li>Combine these two distirbutions according to our model and compare it to the sample data. (<i>2-Word Probabalistic Statement</i>) </li> </ol>
