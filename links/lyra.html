    <h2>tldr;</h2>
    <p>I joined MIT weblab competition and created an open world music sharing website with my friends</p>

    <h2> Some background</h2>
    <p> So I decided to take a jab at making websites. So I spent a whole month learning about Requests and HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h2>Idea</h2>

    <p> The theme this year was press any key to start, which of course lends directly to a game like theme. So we decided to create 
        an open world like music sharing platform.
    </p>
    <p> The idea was that players would show up in the same world, where Nodes exist. People can queue music on the node, and everyone would listen to
        same music. The idea was that this would allow people with similar music taste to gather, hence forming mini circles of music tastes. If you want to explore,
        the nodes around you woulf tend to be similar music.</p>

    <h2>The site</h2>
    <p>Also unfortunately the server is down (forever),so here are some vids of the website (kind of) working (sped up)</p>
