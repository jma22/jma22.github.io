        Large User Interface </h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>tldr;</h2>
    <p> I joined a team in the Media Lab to help develop voice control and AR functions for their multimodal website. </p>

    <h2>Large User Interface</h2>
    <p> LUI is a gesture and voice controlled user interface, aimed to facilitate controls on large user interfaces without a mouse and keyboard.
        This <a href = "media.mit.edu/projects/large-user-interface-with-gesture-and-voice-feedback/overview/">linklonk</a> probably explains it better.
    </p>

    <h2> What I did</h2>
    <p> I joined when most of the UI and gesture controls were created. So I had to design a backend with Google Action,Firebase and DialogFlow that can 
        work with the React-based gesture controls.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created basic commands to navigate between pages, but also multimodal commands such as 'openthis', to open a file a user is currently pointing at.
        I also played around with the Prismatic API for creating AR content on a website.
