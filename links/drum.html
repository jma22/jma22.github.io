        Taiko Drum </h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>tldr;</h2>
    <p> I speedrun a taiko drum at MakeMIT with my friends. </p>

    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p> At first we thought about using stuff like accelerometers/capacitors to sense drum hits. But then we resorted to the basics
        - aluminum foil.
    </p>

    <h2>Creation</h2>
    <p> So by layering 4 different pieces of aluminum foil with some tape, we effectively created  4 buttons, that can be closed by hitting the drumstick
        (coated with foil). After some debouncing and flashing to arduino as a keyboard. We were able to play taiko with the drum on our laptops!
