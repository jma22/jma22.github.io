    <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="text"> Percepts of different sensory modalilties have been shown to interact with one another. This study investigates perceptual interactions in visual depth perception between pictorial (two dimensional) and stereo (three dimensional) depth perception. Using a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm and a high density EEG net, the study was conducted on eight subjects using stimuli that involved alternating and detecting depth. By proposing and implementing the Relative Peak Strength variable, the response strengths of each electrode were compared and plotted on a heat map. I found that pictorial and stereo depth perception induced neural activity in different streams of the brain, suggesting these streams function differently when perceiving depth. The heat map for combined depth (pictorial and stereo) was significantly different from the combination of its parts and resembled the heat map of its respective stereo depth scenarios, suggesting that combined depth behaves like a Gestalt with stereo depth acting as the predominant type of depth perceived. The results also showed that pictorial depth reduced neural activity when discriminating different amounts of depth, but increased neural activity when detecting depth. This suggests that pictorial depth plays a supplementary role in comparing different amounts of depth, but does not help during detecting depth. Through looking at depth perception, it is possible to suggest methods to improve immersiveness in stereoscopic displays.</p>
