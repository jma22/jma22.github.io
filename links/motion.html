    <h2>Official blurb: </h2>
    <p>Humans are able to perceive and complete 3D objects from 2D representations, this sense is also known as object permanence - we know that points do not just disappear.
        Theoretically, if given the depth map of some object, and given that it is in motion such that all points have been observed at least once. Even if it is a 2D representation, it should be possible to reconstruct the full complete 3D object.
    </p>
    <h3>Goal: </h3>
    <p>Using surface dynamics permanence to solve the non-rigid structure from motion problem. The input would be a depth/stereo stream and the output is the 3D shape at any given time.
    <h3>Motivation: </h3>
        <p>
        Humans can easily reason about an object’s shape under non-rigid motions. This seemingly easy task is computationally hard. We would like to tackle this problem by assuming that the key component for solving this relies on:
        Local surface permanence: Local surface patches never disappear.
        Motion for occluded surfaces is inferred from the observable ones, i.e. a dynamics model for the motion/deformation of depth surfaces.</p>
        
    <h3>Contribution compared to previous works:</h3><p>
    Previous methods for tackling this problem mainly relies on volume deformation. It assumes that each frame can be deformed into a canonical volume, and all depth maps can be registered into this space. 
    Problems with this method is that: heavy regularization is imposed on the deformation field to make the registration plausible. Also, deforming the volume can not express topological changes. 
    </p><p>
    In our formulation, the basic elements would be local surface patches. We assume that those patches are permanent, and aim to reason about the object’s shape by learning a dynamics model among the elements. Therefore it would be expressive enough for topological changes and removing heavy regularizations on the deformation field by learning the dynamics directly.
