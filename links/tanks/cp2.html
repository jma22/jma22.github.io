<h1>Checkpoint 2: Genetic algorithm</h1>
<h2> Intro</h2>
<p>A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that mimics evolution to do intelligent 'guesses' to a solution, here I would try to apply such an algorithmon a neural network, specifically to the weights of a neural network.</p>
<h2>Genetic algorithms:
</h2>
<p> Here's the general flow of the algorithm: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Initialize N random sets of weights/neural nets, these would be the initial population</li>
  <li> Evaluate all of them and give them each a 'fitness' score based on task, do multiple runs per net and average to increase reliability</li>
  <li> Take top X networks as parents, take best performing net as 'elite'</li>
  <li> Crossover the parents, there are many ways to do this, the general idea is to mix the weights of two networks</li>
  <li> Mutate the weights, add some gaussain noise with some set probability</li>
  <li> Add elite unaltered to children. Repeat the process on children. </li>
</ol>

<p>Since set it seemed like setting and retrieving weights and converting between pytorch arrays could be a pain, I decided to make my own networks. Since there is no back prop involved, this was relatively easy. I just needed to recreate softmax, relu and dense layers. </p>

<p>Score calc: roundssurvived + 1500*win</p>
<p>network: 58-128-128-6 w/relu and softmax</p>
<p>Input: x,y,aimx,aimy for each tank; x,y,directionx,directiony, active (1/0) for each bullet (max 10)</p>

<p>PS i later learnt that the network could be simplified by a lot, also scoring with rounds survived is not optimal, since the tanks would actually learn to not shoot.</p>

<h2>Try1</h2>
<h3> Params:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>population_size = 200</li>
    <li>parent_size = 25</li>
    <li>generations = 100</li>
    <li>n=3(games per agent during testing)</li>
    <li>mut_prob = 0.1</li>
    <li>mut_rate = 0.1</li>
    <li>maxround = 500</li>
  </ul>
    
 
    <h3>Technicalities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mating: choose parents uniformly amongst group of parents</li>
        <li>Crossover: halfpoint of flatten weight matrix</li>
        <li>Net: 58-128-6</li>
        
      </ul>

<p>As I can see they just learn how to move away from each other. I realized that flattening and cutting the weights in half arbitrally doesn't really make that much sense.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Try2</h2>
<p> Several changes here, I first make mating such that parents are chose with probability proportional to score, and crossover the weights instead of the whole array. I also simplified the network.
</p>
<h3> Params:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>population_size = 100</li>
    <li>parent_size = 25</li>
    <li>generations = 100</li>
    <li>n=2</li>
    <li>mut_prob = 0.1</li>
    <li>mut_rate = 1</li>
    <li>maxround = 250</li>
  </ul>
    
<h3>Technicalities</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mating: parents chosen with probability proportional to score</li>
    <li>Crossover: each weight has 50% chance to be from each parent</li>
    <li>Net: 58-128-6</li>
    <li>Slower bullet speed</li>
    </ul>

<p>It just shoots everywhere now, at least it shoots?</p>

<hr>
<h2>Try3</h2>
<p>Put more layers to net.</p>

    <li>Net: 58-128-128-6</li>

<p>Still randomly shoots?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Try4</h2>
<p> A paper said that wieghts should work synchronously, so I swap weights by column, keeping the connections that feed into the next neuron the same. </p>
<h3> Params:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>population_size = 150</li>
    <li>parent_size = 30</li>
    <li>generations = 300</li>
    <li>n=3</li>
    <li>mut_prob = 0.15</li>
    <li>mut_rate = 1</li>
    <li>maxround = 300</li>
  </ul>
    
<h3>Technicalities</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Crossover: weights swapped out by column (50% each parent)</li>
    </ul>
