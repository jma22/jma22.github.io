  <h1>Checkpoint 5: Take it easy!</h1>
  <h2> Intro</h2>
  <p>After doing this for 5 days straight during quarantine,I decided to take a break and come back to it. And the first idea I had was make the simplest possible bot with no hidden layers.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>After pondering what could possibly be wrong, whether it be the algorithm or not enough training time, i decided to simplify the network and use classic actor-critic.</p>
  <h2>eznet</h2>
    <p> Everything is the same as q classic actor-critic but the network is severely simplified.</p>
